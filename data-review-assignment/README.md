# Welcome to DataSense!

Hey there! ðŸŽ‰ This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using the super cool [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) tool. DataSense is all about providing insightful data reviews and analytics in a way that's easy to use and understand.

## Getting Started

So, to get things rolling, you'll wanna run the development server. Just pick one of these commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is up and running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser to see DataSense in action! ðŸš€

This project also uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), which is a pretty neat font family designed for Vercel.

## Design Choices

In making DataSense, I decided to go with the Taik design system for a few reasons:

1. **Consistency**: Taik gives a nice set of design components that keep everything looking uniform. This makes the user experience way better and the interface more intuitive.

2. **Accessibility**: The components in Taik are made with accessibility in mind, so everyone, including folks with disabilities, can navigate and use the app without a hitch.

3. **Scalability**: As DataSense grows, Taik's modular design makes it easy to add new features without messing up what's already there.

### Approach and Assumptions

My approach was to whip up a clean and responsive interface that really gets users engaged with the data. I figured that users would appreciate a straightforward navigation system and clear visualizations of data insights.

### Improvements

If I had more time, I'd focus on a few improvements:

- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: I'd love to integrate some fancier data visualization libraries to give users interactive charts and graphs. Some libraries that could be useful include:
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
  - [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
  - [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Setting up a feedback system would be awesome to gather user insights and keep improving the app based on real-world usage. Tools like:
  - [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)
  - [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)

- **Performance Optimization**: I'd do some thorough performance testing and optimization to make sure the app runs smoothly, even with big datasets. Tools that can help include:
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
  - [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).
