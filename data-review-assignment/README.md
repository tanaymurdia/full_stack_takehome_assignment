# Welcome to DataSense!

You can explore this project through the following link: [DataSense](https://full-stack-takehome-assignment-zeta.vercel.app/). It is developed using Next.js for the backend, with React and Tailwind CSS on the front end.
## Getting Started

You can run it on the local server, by cloning this repo and run the following commands:

```bash
cd data-review-assignment
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser to see DataSense in action!

### Approach and Assumptions

My approach was to whip up a clean and responsive interface that really gets users engaged with the data. I figured that users would appreciate a straightforward navigation system with sorting and filtering and clear visualizations of data.

### Improvements

If I had more time, I'd focus on a few improvements:

- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: I'd love to integrate some fancier data visualization libraries to give users interactive charts and graphs. Some libraries that could be useful include:
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
  - [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
  - [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Setting up a feedback system would be awesome to gather user insights and keep improving the app based on real-world usage. Tools like:
  - [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)
  - [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)

- **Performance Optimization**: I'd do some thorough performance testing and optimization to make sure the app runs smoothly, even with big datasets. Tools that can help include:
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
  - [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).
